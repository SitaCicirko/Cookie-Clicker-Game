# Cookie-Clicker-Game

Requirements achieved:

- Fetch upgrade data
- Code is organized and reusable
- Implemented event listeners
- Used local storage to save and restore the cookie count
- Used setInterval

I created three buttons used event listeners: one to click and earn cookies every second using setInterval, another to load saved progress from local storage and a third to delete cookies. Main button is for adding single cookie each time you click on it.
Each button is styled and is using dynamic hover effects, button scaling and animations meeting Stretch Requirements.

The game progress is saved and loaded using the browser's local storage.
I also implement error handling using try/catch.
Ive also console.log-ed most of my code to make sure everything is working fine.

I mostly struggled with API. After re-watching videos form last week and doing a broad research about I managed to achieve the tasks.

I searched online for inspiration and examples to help me style the game. :D
